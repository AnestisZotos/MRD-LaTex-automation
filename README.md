# MRD-LaTex-automation


**1. What is the situation?**

Every year MRD has about 20-24 different Committees (e.g. Committee for the rights of child to education, etc.). Every Committee has to prepare a `.pdf` document for the closing ceremony. The documents are ALL THE SAME in terms of formatting. They only differ in **content**.

**2. So, what is the problem?**

Both board members and students are digitally iliterate. Even though they are all given a single `.doc` file (template) to use for their final document, (the last 3 years) the vast majority of them manages to MESS UP the formatting of the document. As a result, tech support members are wasting time and sleep at Saturday night (of the conference) to fix formatting, alignment and, in general, the form of the `.doc` files, so that they can be presented the next morning. 

**3. What is the idea?**

The idea is to find a good, reusable and automated solution for this problem. In order to do so, we can leverage LaTex and its (great) functionality that helps us predefine the form of the document and just focus on the _content_. 

**4. What is our task?**

The task is to create a `.tex` template for the documents and use this, instead of the `.doc` one that is used so far. The `.tex` file will NOT be used directly by the end users (board memebers and students), but from the tech support members. End users will provide us the needed content through a web form (next step).
